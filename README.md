# WaterRippleShader2D

A 2D water ripple algorithm implemented as a shader

Original algorithm can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160418004149/http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm).

When running the demo, the left will be a CPU implementation and the right will be a shader implementation.
YouTube explanation of the CPU implementation by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) can be found [here](https://youtu.be/BZUdGqeOD0w?si=AyT3djnp807gmVqd).

You can interact with the demo by clicking on the left-hand side of the window.
